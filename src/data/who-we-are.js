  description: `<p>Nicky Tong and Claire Kingan-Jones met at the Nanette Cameron Interior Design
                 School. Nicky and Claire both bring a wealth of design and business experience
                 to Entrance Design.</p><br><p>Nicky Tong's love of design started at the young age
                 of 17 as an exchange student in Germany. From there she travelled the world
                 extensively as an international flight attendant visiting the world's finest
                 museums and galleries, opening her eyes to international design. It's this design
                 inspiration that she wants to bring into NZ homes. Nicky has been working casually
                 on interior design projects until her young family started school.</p><br><p>Claire
                 Kingan-Jones grew up in a creative environment in South Africa. After leaving
                 South Africa in her early 20's she based herself in London, from there she
                 travelled for 4 years before meeting her future husband and settling in New
                 Zealand. Claire established and set up her eponymous clothing label Kingan-Jones
                 but after almost 20 years of working in the rag trade, Claire has now shifted her
                 design focus to the world of interior design.</p><br><p>Together this duo brings a
                 dynamic passion and energy to creating a new way to interior design your home.
                 Combining their strengths they have come up with a concept that creates an
                 exceptional experience, with the client's unique personal style at the forefront
                 of their designs, creating spaces that compliment and enhance lifestyles.</p>`,
