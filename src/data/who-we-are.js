                partnership, as is the case with the dynamic duo behind Entrance Design,
                Claire Kingan-Jones and Nicky Tong.</p><br>
                <p>Meeting at the Nanette Cameron Interior Design School, Nicky and Claire
                draw on their well-rounded experience and shared passion to create enviable
                and timeless interiors with personality and liveability at the core.</p><br>
                <p>The design duo’s distinct sense of passion, energy and warmth, set them
                apart in an industry often perceived as intimidating and unapproachable –
                a misconception Claire and Nicky seek to change.</p><br>
                <p>Combining their strengths, they have come up with a concept that makes the
                interior design process a fun and rewarding experience. With their client's
                unique personal style at the forefront of their designs, Entrance Design
                strives to create homes that ultimately complement and enhance lifestyles.</p>

                <em><p>“Whether it’s a small room update or an entire home refresh, we provide cost
                competitive solutions with an emphasis on transparency throughout the process.” – Claire Kingan-Jones</p></em>
                <br>
                <em><p>“We understand every client is different and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. We can lead you
                step-by-step through the design process or, you can take the lead through our online service, drawing on
                our wealth of experience along the way,” – Nicky Tong</p></em>
